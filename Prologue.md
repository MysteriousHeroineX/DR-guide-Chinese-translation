In the past year the use of Domino Reduction in FMC has grown in popularity among the best at the event and has led to two world records: Harry Savage’s 17 single at TGBBO 2019 and Sebastiano Tronto’s 16 single at FMC 2019. Seeing those incredible solves, and missing out on the two solutions, we (the two authors) have decided to learn this method and want to take you with us in this journey.

There is currently no written documentation about Domino Reduction and the only way you can learn how to do it is by reading other people’s example solves or by asking them to explain you the reasoning behind their choices. This has led to a bit of confusion. There are steps of the method that have different names around the world and there are others that don’t even have one. The purpose of this guide is therefore to offer a more schematic approach to Domino Reduction, uniforming the terminology.

Before you start, we highly recommend you read Sebastiano’s FMC guide (at https://fmcsolves.cubing.net/fmc_tutorial_ENG.pdf), also known as “The Bible” in Italy. This guide’s structure will be similar. Most of the terms and acronyms we will be using are common knowledge for regular FMC solvers but if you are new to the event you should start there and get used to them. Sebastiano also provided us with some example solves and helped us during the writing of this guide. Our aim is to cover all we know about Domino Reduction, adding to what he already talked about in the Bible about FMC. Think of this as kind of a “Part 2” of his work, or at least this is what we hope it becomes.

As you may have understood, Italian is our first language. So if you find any mistakes or if you think something is explained poorly, feel free to message us directly at our E-mail address at the end of this guide.

We will be using DR from now on to talk about Domino Reduction and we will refer to Elayer edges already in the E layer as ”good” edges and non E-layer edges in the E layer as ”bad” edges.

All the setup cases will be “DR - x E-edges, y corners” and we will call these “x edges, y corners”. As for the example solves, we will be using “c” for corners, “e” for edges and “x” for centers (as suggested by Sebastiano), as well as the most common names for the different stages in the solve e.g. “F2L-1”. So for example, 3c2e2e4x means: “All but 3 corners, a double swap of edges and 4 centers.

DR is easier to learn than you would expect and it requires very little knowledge of FMC to understand the basics of it. But in order to achieve its full potential you need to master a few advanced techniques.

To complete a DR you must know how to do an edge orientation. In order to give a full solution with DR you will most likely need to know NISS and corner and/or edge insertions. If instead you want to get a really good DR solve, you either get very lucky or combine the DR finish with Reverse NISS, center insertions, slicey shenanigans, and many other advanced FMC resources.
