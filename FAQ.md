## FAQ

**What is DR?**

Domino Reduction is a 2-axis EO with Corner Orientation. You may think of 2-axis EO as a normal EO with all the E layer edges on the E slice. Once the cube has been reduced to a Domino (let’s say on U/D), it can be solved using only the [U, D, L2 R2, B2, F2] group.

**Why should I learn DR?**

At the beginning, DR may seem hard to set-up or even harder to “finish” in a reasonable number of moves. On the other hand, mastering it can lead to very nice solves quite consistently.

**When should I start learning DR?**

After you have learned EO you will have all the tools necessary to achieve a DR. Although if you know only EO as an advanced technique, there are definitely other things you can learn before DR to improve your solves much more.

**What do you mean with “after DR the cube feels and looks good”?**

You could hear some of the very good FMC solvers say something like this. It is a subjective feeling, that comes mostly with experience. A cube with DR looks easier to solve than a cube without it, in the same way a cube with EO looks easier than a cube without it.

DR solves may not be better than any other, but they feel very different and have more room for creativity.

**Is DR really that good?**

More than 80% of combinations have a 10 move or less DR. Some of them are difficult to find but after some practice you can consistently achieve DR in less than 12 moves. Once the DR is done, God’s number for solving the cube is 18 moves (http://kociemba.org/cube.htm), and this solutions can be found with “human” methods most of the times. This means that DR is a reliable and consistent method to get sub-30 solves!
