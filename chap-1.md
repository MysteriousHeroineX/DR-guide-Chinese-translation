# Part one: A Good EO

The first step of the DR is edge orientation, possibly a “good” one. How do you define a “good EO”? “Less than 4 moves” or “I have some pairs and blocks” are possible answers but since your aim is to get a DR, we usually consider a good EO the following:

*Most corners are oriented (or 1 move away) and some E-edges are already in the E layer*

Let’s take a look at two simple examples:

>First EO – Example
>
>Scramble: R' U' F D2 R2 B2 D2 R2 B' F' L2 U' F2 U2 L D U' F' L' D' R2 U R' U' F
>
>U'F // EO (F/B) (2/2)

An F/B EO can lead to a DR with oriented corners on U/D or R/L. If you do a z rotation (this preserves EO), you will see that you already have 4 oriented corners and 3 good edges. This is a promising start for a domino reduction.

If you look at the F/B EO without the z rotation, you only have 2 oriented corners and 2 good edges.

It’s very important that you check both possible orientations of the cube after the EO. Although there are only 3 possible DRs: U/D, R/L, F/B you can get to each one of them from two different EO’s. Keep this in mind or you’ll miss 3 starts out of the possible 6 (50% is a lot!)

>Second EO – Example
>
>Scramble: R' U' F L2 B2 R2 U2 F D2 B' L2 F' D2 U B L' U2 F' R2 B2 U' R' D R' U' F
>
>B' R' D' L' // EO (R/L) (4/4)

Even though there are only 4 oriented corners on U/D and two bad edges, we are 1 move away from a very promising case. With F or F’ we go from 2 bad edges to 1 and from 4 oriented corners to 5 (4-1+2).

Try to play around with these two starts and see if you can orient all corners or get 4/4 good edges in a few moves. Once you’re convinced it is a difficult task without a hint, you can move on to the next part.
